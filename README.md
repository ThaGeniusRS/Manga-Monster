# Manga-Monster
Manga Monster is a catalog of many different asian comics from a range of genres and demographics. While giving background information on many genres, authors, artist, and demographics, Manga Monster's most crucial feature is that it puts ratings in the hands of the users. Users will give their own reviews and ratings on the site which will influence the comics, genres, authors, etcetera that are highlighted throughout the website.

## Motivation
For about as long as I can remember I have been obsessed with comics and this unique literary universe. As I got older, I became infatuated with comics outside of America. However, when I would find comics that were from, say, different countries or different production studios, I almost always found it impossible to find a single place to access all the new comics I loved. This is what drew my inspiration for Manga Monster. Giving other anime and manga fans like me a tool that can be used to find all the things they love to read in one place and also making it easier to find great new comics to enjoy.
